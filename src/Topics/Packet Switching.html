        <h1>Packet Switching</h1>
        <p>Packet switching, like circuit switching before it, is a method to allow machines to communicate with each other.
            A collection of machines or “nodes” which have the capability to communicate with each other is known as a network.
            Packet switching and circuit switching are both methods which a network may use to pass data through the correct nodes
            and links between nodes for the data to arrive at the correct destination.
        </p>

        <h2>Circuit Switching</h2>
        <p> Circuit switching was the method used in the early telephone networks whereby when a call was made network operators
            would have to use switches in the network to create a continuous circuit between the two parties in the call.
            Once a connection is established it is exclusively available to the start and end nodes for the full duration of
            their communication. In circuit switching once the connection is established the communication data will mindlessly
            follow the path set up for it.
        </p>

        <h2>Package Switching</h2>
        <p> In packet switching all data is split into chunks called packets. Each packet knows where its destination node
            in the network is. As such the network does not have to create a specific route for any one packet. Each node
            in the network can receive a packet and based on the information in the packets header, where the destination
            information is stored, can send it on to a node in the network closer to the packets destination. This process
            continues until the packet arrives at its destination. This method of routing means links in the network will be
            shared by multiple packets from different communication sessions. As the route a packet takes is altered
            dynamically packet switching in computer networks is crucial in making sure the full capacity of the network is
            used. Packets can quickly and automatically be routed around areas of high congestion in the network. Similarly
            packets can be easily routed around nodes that have failed. Thus increasing the robustness of a network.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>The change from Circuit switching as a method of communication to packet switching marks an important moment in
            the history of the digital age. This technology enabled the widespread exchange of data and directly lead to the
            rise of the internet and the World Wide Web. This is why it should be recognised as a key component in bringing
            about the beginning of the information age.
