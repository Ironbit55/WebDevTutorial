        <h1>Internet Protocol Suite</h1>
        <p>
            The internet protocol suite is a suite of communication protocols for use by computer networks, specifically the
            internet. It is commonly known as TCP/IP as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet protocol) are
            its most important protocols and were defined at the start of its creation. A crucial aspect in its design was]
            that a network implementing it should easily be able to connect to other networks even if the networks were
            radically different. This was achieved by the use of a computer called a router which would accept packets from
            each network, convert them to the required format, using knowledge provided to It about the networks, and
            forward the packets on to the other network based on the destination information stored in the packet.

        <h2>Internet Protocol(IP)</h2>
        <p>
            The internet protocol is a communications protocol that uses <a target="_blank" href="Packet%20Switching.html" >packet switching</a> to route packets from the source
            host to the destination host. The internet protocol defines the format of packets used by networks implementing
            it as well as also handling IP addressing and routing. The internet protocol will assign each device using it
            with a unique identifier known as an IP address. Hosts on the network are then responsible for routing packets
            through the network to their destination using information in the header of each packet such as the IP address
            of the source host and the destination host. The internet protocol is connectionless meaning packets sent from
            the same communication session may arrive at their destination in the wrong order.
            TCP was developed in conjunction with IP to address this issue.

        <h2>Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) </h2>
        <p>
            The transmission control protocol is not a direct replacement of the Internet Protocol. It can more be thought
            of as a wrapper for it. TCP can be used by an application without the application having to know anything about
            the underlying communication protocol and how exactly it routes data i.e. how the internet protocol functions.
            Packets sent through the Internet protocol can be lost, corrupted and delivered out of order. TCP detects and
            corrects these problems without the application using it having to know they even occurred. The application can
            then rely on the packets being delivered in the correct order and identical to the state they were in when
            originally sent. Data to be transmitted by TCP is split into segments and given a TCP header. These segments are
            then encapsulated into an IP packet to be sent by the Internet Protocol. Contained within the TCP header
